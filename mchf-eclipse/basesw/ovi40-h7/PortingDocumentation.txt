* Created new repo cloned from my local repo
* created new branch h7 from active-devel
* created dir basesw/ovi40-h7
* Generated from ovi40-h7.ioc CubeMX sources
* Added most to commit, some to .gitignore (license or not used)
* As usual CubeMX forgets the DSP assembly ./Drivers/CMSIS/DSP/Source/TransformFunctions/arm_bitreversal2.S
Need to copy from original source in CubeMX install dir.
